Movies are entertaining and can inspire us. Movies take up a large chunk of our time, and we rather not wast that time watching a poorly created movie. These reviews from others will help guide us in deciding what movie we want to watch on our streaming platforms. On a larger industry scale, these reviews can help directors, actors, and film staff learn from good and bad examples of films. Is the issue the story? The acting? The pacing of the film? The CGI (computer generated images) or props? It is tough to take criticisms, but brutally honest advice can help you make better movies."],"metadata":{"id":"fYG9zicH6dNj"},"id":"fYG9zicH6dNj"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Dataset Description\n","Write a couple of paragraphs to describe (1) the dataset that you are working on and (2) how was the dataset created (e.g., manually created by curators)\n","\n","**Johnny Response**\n","\n","My dataset will come from the the movie review data from CS Cornell.\n","* [Link to cs cornell movie review webstie](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/)\n","\n","It was created by Bo Pang and Lillian Lee from Cornell University.

) . \\ni was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr . magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations ) , and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well . \\nrarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness . \\nas everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind , i was left sitting there , absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen . \\ncan something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world ? \\nright from the beginning , i knew i was in trouble . \\nin the opening scenes , each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be , to simply serve as real-life duplicates of their cartoon clones . \\nwhen referring to them , people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be ( \\\" oh , hi penny ! \\nis brain with you ? \\\" ) . \\ncreating one-dimensional replicas is one thing ; having mere names take the place of them is quite another . \\nthe \\\" plot \\\" , shall we call it , stays fairly in tune with the original series . \\nmatthew broderick stars as john brown ( how creative is that ? ) , \\na security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex ( why , rupert everett , for the love of god why ? ? ? ! ! ! ) , who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events . \\nbrown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new law-enforcement technology wherein he's joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form ( drumroll , please ) . . . \\ninspector gadget ! \\n>from here on out , the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations ( although , to be fair , my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind ) . \\nthere's something about an evil gadget taking over the city ( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon's dentures from there's something about mary ) and it all ends with ( what else ? ) a bunch of post-credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself . \\nto be honest , i wasn't much paying attention to these \\\" treats \\\" . \\ni was just glad that it was over . \\n\",\n          \"the first in a very long list of things wrong with \\\" i still know what you did last summer \\\" is the title . \\nthink about it for a second . \\nif the last movie was called \\\" i know what you did last summer \\\" , wouldn't the next movie have to be \\\" i still know what you did two summers ago \\\" ? \\nif anyone working on this movie had an i . q . \\ngreater than five would have thought about it logically and said , \\\" hey . . . \\nwait a minute \\\" . \\nbut alas , the people behind this film are obviously idiots , so i won't hold them to that . \\nwhat i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands , even for a teenage slasher flick . \\ni guess i'm one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film ( emphasis on the \\\" kind of \\\" ) . \\nit wasn't great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good , but at least it didn't have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it's sequel did . \\nthere are just so many problems with this movie that it's hard trying to figure out where to start . \\nfirst of all , i guess , is the setting . \\nthe movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas , other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting . \\nexactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james ( jennifer love hewitt , one of the only survivors of the first film ) and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up ? \\nthe movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through . \\nin one scene , julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can't get out , no matter how hard she tries . \\nwhen julie discovers she's going to slowly fry to death , she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue . \\nnow , this is all fine and dandy except for one thing ; instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth , why not just turn the freakin' thing off ? \\nin another scene , one of the characters , after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker , says to julie , \\\" just don't tell anybody it rained the whole time . \\\" \\noh yeah , i've just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered , but hey , i'll crack jokes anyway . \\nafter all , it is in the script . \\nthe film's only saving graces are a few well-executed suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the \\\" re-animator himself , jeffrey combs . \\nhe brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie . \\nway to go , jeffrey . \\ni have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept it's head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson . \\nwith \\\" scream \\\" and even it's sequel , he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter . \\nhis ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers , and i think \\\" i still know \\\" has really suffered by not having him on board . \\nthe cool atmosphere is still there this time around , but i just didn't like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one . \\neven though the movie doesn't have williamson , it still has a hacky ending , trying to do what kevin did with the first two \\\" scream \\\" s by ( some may consider this a spoiler , but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever , then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes ) having two killers and , this time , having one of them being a family member to the other . \\ni think someone in the audience put it best when , after the movie had ended with another \\\" the killer is back ! \\\" \\ncliffhanger , he said \\\" who is this time , the grandma ? \\\" \\nall in all , \\\" i still know \\\" tries to be as successful as the first the film was , but really fails in the attempt . \\ni mean , it's okay when slasher movies rip-off each other , but when they start copying themselves . . . \\n\",\n          \"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in . \\nwe hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves . \\nwithout an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye . \\neven without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema . \\nbut do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? \\nexploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept . \\nis the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? \\nmidnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth . \\nas joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration . \\nduring the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . ' \\nas joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead . ' \\na troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone . \\nhaving adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody . \\njoe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream . \\nhe romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance . \\nby the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing . \\njust as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success . \\nbut how realistic are these ideals ? \\njoe had raped and been raped in texas . \\nthe scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas . \\nalongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation . \\nthe ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention . \\nschlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny . \\nwe understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame . \\nhe runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york . \\nin the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself . \\nstanding up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh . \\nschlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation . \\nbeyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison . \\nthe fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation . \\nit is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men . \\njoe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . ' \\nthere are two predominant images of new york . \\nthe first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty . \\nthe other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth . \\njoe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter . \\nmirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men . \\njoe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions . \\nthe people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity . \\nwhat has become of joe's american dream ? \\nschlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party . \\njoe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex . \\nat the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami . \\ncontrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence . \\nthere is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors . \\nthe party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals . \\njoe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils . \\nthe american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent . \\nas joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him . \\nhis masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished . \\nfor joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity . \\ntossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami . \\nthe final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window . \\ninstead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe . \\nreflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus' window with joe hardly taking notice . \\nthe scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before . \\nthe world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream . \\nno longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means . \\nmidnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream . \\nthere is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family . \\nthen there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city . \\njoe's attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york . \\nduring his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man . \\nan allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck's progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}],"source":["# since we're using google collab, pay extra attention to your google drive paths\n","## sometimes, files are not in the place you expect\n","## When in doubt, use ls bash commands (! ls) in separate code blocks\n","\n","# this load reviews def combines all the text files into one big dataframe\n","# you may have to modify the encoding variable if the text isn't read correctly with the 'with open()' command\n","\n","def load_reviews(path, label):\n","    '''Load all .txt files from a given folder and assign the same label.'''\n","    files = glob.glob(os.path.join(path, '*.txt')) # path of extracted tar.gz files\n","    texts = [] # empty placeholder for where we will store the info\n","    for fpath in files:\n","        with open(fpath, 'r', encoding='latin-1') as f: # you might need to change the latin-1 if this fails for you -JU\n","            texts.append(f.read())\n","    return pd.DataFrame({'review': texts, 'label': label})\n","\n","df_pos = load_reviews('txt_sentoken/pos', 1)  # positive reviews labeled 1 according to the website\n","df_neg = load_reviews('txt_sentoken/neg', 0)  # negative reviews labeled 0 according to the website\n","\n","df = pd.concat([df_pos, df_neg], ignore_index=True) # the data doesn't come in nice, so concat to combine the thing together -JU\n","df = df.sample(frac=1, random_state=42).reset_index(drop=True)  # shuffle\n","\n","print('Dataset shape:', df.shape)\n","df.head()\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"29135ebd","metadata":{"id":"29135ebd"},"source":["## 4.

associated with \\\" progress . \\\" \\ngiles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis . \\nhis house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth . \\nthis is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns \\\" erstwhile fogy \\\" giles into a three-dimensional human being . \\ndespite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love . \\nand , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it's possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual places . \\ngiles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go . \\nwhat he doesn't realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii . \\na nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress . \\njust as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it's love at first sight . \\ngiles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes . \\n ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn't realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . ) \\neventually , not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol's home is located . \\nbostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) . \\neventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man's advice . \\nbut , while giles' affection runs deep , ronnie's feelings are less constant . \\nlove and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that . \\nin fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect . \\nit suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it . \\nin his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target . \\nin the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited . \\nfrom start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ? he's in almost every frame . \\nit's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions . \\njason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie . \\nhe is charismatic , and it's not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie . \\nmeanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin . \\nlove and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a \\\" fish out of water \\\" tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) . \\nyet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots . \\nit has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile . \\n\",\n          \"reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . \\nthe guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : \\\" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel \\\" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . \\nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . \\ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , \\\" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! \\\" \\nit's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . \\nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? \\nauteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's \\\" style \\\" , not the director's that winds up on screen . \\nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \\\" sometimes less is more \\\" . \\nand his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \\\" character \\\" . . . grammar \\nbe damned ) . \\n \\\" how did you know that ? \\\" \\nthe stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . \\n . \\n . \\nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently . \\nhe's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . \\nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . \\ntheir company's current logo could be \\\" we ride the trends \\\" . \\nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . \\nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . \\naffleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch . \\nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \\\" serious \\\" movie getting . \\nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) \\njames frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . \\nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him . \\nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . \\nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . \\nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant . \\nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . \\nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . \\nthough it's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . \\nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . \\nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau \\n ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . \\nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . \\nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . \\ncharacter problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . \\nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . \\nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . \\ncharlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . \\nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . \\ngary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . \\nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . \\n\",\n          \"well , as i check my score card for what i've done this holiday weekend , it reads good ideas : 0 and dumb ideas : 1 . \\ni don't know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie . \\nbut in my defense , i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him . \\nthe film that i'm talking about is `a night at the roxbury , ' one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit . \\nwayne and garth , these two are not . \\nrather , we meet doug and steve butabi ( the actors' names are not worth mentioning ) , two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city , the roxbury . \\ndriving in their dad's bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice , they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club . \\n`have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt , ' they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change . \\ntheir second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick-up lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl ( `let me see that label . \\njust as i thought - made in heaven , ' says one of the brothers ) . \\nand , like the losers that they are , they fail to do either for much of the film . \\nhowever , as fate would have it , an accidental meeting with `what-ever-happened-to' richard grieco gives them the all-important ticket to get in . \\ntheir sad lives take on a whole new direction . \\nthey make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene . \\nand they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women . \\nbut their newfound popularity does not impress their father , who has other plans for them . \\nthe unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a one-joke movie , and the brothers are the joke . \\nactually , there's about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff . \\nalas , too long for tv and way too short for a feature-length film . \\nthus , there just isn't enough material to sustain the 83-minute movie . \\nthere's no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaway's europop song , what is love . \\ni was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash . \\nto take up more film time , there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug . \\nthis creates not only friction between the brothers , but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well . \\nshe's educated and a forebearing witch . \\nmeanwhile , doug is a complete loser . \\nhow did these two ever get together ? \\ni suppose that if i can ever figure out the answer to that question , i'll have figured out why i decided to go and see this movie . \\nif you're looking for entertainment , you won't find it at the roxbury . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":
